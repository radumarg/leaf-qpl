## About

* A statically typed quantum programming language with Rust-like syntax and conservative quantum extensions that preserve the look and feel of Rust.
* Linear qubit ownership and mutable borrowing: no-cloning and qubit-use discipline are enforced statically by the type checker.
* Safe ancilla management, with support for automatic uncomputation.
* Lightweight quantum contracts for tracking properties of entanglement for program qubits at compile time.
* Designed for formal verification, with program properties proved in Lean 4 against a type-safe intermediate representation.
* Detailed diagnostics designed for both human developers and AI-assisted code generation.
* Practical by construction: compiles to OpenQASM 3, with QIR support planned.
* Built for the fault-tolerant quantum computing era.

Code example:

```leaf
general fn coin_flip() -> bit {
    let q = qalloc();
    H(&q);
    measr(q)
}

general fn main() -> bit {
    coin_flip()
}
```
